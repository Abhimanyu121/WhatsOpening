This application utlizes FOAM contracts and api for POIs and has a second contract on Matic for reporting opening and closing times. Matic has been chosen to reduce onboarding fiction, lesser amount of gas fee can be easily handled with gas stations. Users can check and report opening and closing times without having any foam tokens or eth.</br>
You can find APKs [here](https://github.com/Abhimanyu121/ColorCoded-FOAM-Maps/releases/tag/V1).

## Traction so Far
This application got featured in Community newsletters of FOAM mentioning how Matic worked charms for UX, you can ping me or FOAM team for a copy of newsletter.<br/><br/>

## Video
You can find a small video made by FOAM team demonstrating all the features of the application (some of the features are on Rinkeby and others on Matic). [here](https://vimeo.com/452450616).</br>
## Reason for making it a mobile app
People usually prefer to check opening and closing times/ places on a mobile app instead of opening a website, and if a Dapp would have been made, it would have had made the ux even more terrible.
## Features
- Check opening and closing time of a POI.
- Submit opening and closing time of a POI.
- Fast and cheap transactions for opening and closing times, thanks to Matic(coverable with gas station).
- Upvote and downvote opening and closing time of a POI.
- Custodial Wallet Services.
- Custodial service can be used to send meta tx or airdrop some eth to minimize user fiction.
- Use of Matic based Contracts
- Adding New POI.
- If user has zero eth, user still can submit opening and closing times(Thanks to Matic layer 2).
- If user has zero FOAM tokens it shows user a link to guide to get started.
- Users can view all POIs , Maps loads dynamically as user moves through map.
- Users can Challenge POIs.
- Users can Access their dashboard and manage FOAM token allowences.

## Technical Specifications

##### Note :- You can use `6843DC59D41289CC20E905180F6702621DCB9798B4413C031F8CB6EF0D9FC3E0` it has FOAM tokens on rinkeby.
##### Note :- Please refrain from entering exceptional values, proper exception handling might not be present everywhere.
##### Note :-If your last transaction is merged by making new transaction still gives you pending transaction, hit the transaction button again.
##### Note :-After adding POI it takes a few minutes so please reopen the app after some time you would see your POI.
